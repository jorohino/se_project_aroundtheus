**Description**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. HTML and CSS are utilized to create a responsive design for a webpage. A grid layout creates the structure of an image gallery. Media queries are deployed to determine the layout of the grid, as well as placement of other elements.
