// The UserInfo class is responsible for rendering information about the user on the page.

class UserInfo {
    constructor()
}
  // This class should:

  // Take an object with the selectors of two elements into the constructor: one for the profileâ€™s name 
    // element and one for its job element.

  // Have a public method named getUserInfo(), which returns an object containing information about the user. 
    // This method will be handy for cases when it's necessary to display the user data in the open form.

  // Have a public method named setUserInfo(), which takes new user data and adds it to the page. 
    // This method should be used after successful submission of the profile form.

  // Create an instance of the UserInfo class in index.js and use its methods as described.
